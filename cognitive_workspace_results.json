      "final_answer": "Artificial intelligence learns through various techniques, with one key method being transfer learning. Transfer learning involves reusing knowledge from one task to improve performance on another task. This approach allows AI models to leverage previously acquired knowledge and adapt it to new situations, ultimately enhancing their learning capabilities.\n\nIn transfer learning, a pre-trained model is used as a starting point, and then fine-tuned on a new dataset related to the target task. By transferring knowledge from the source task to the target task, the model can learn faster and more effectively than starting from scratch. This technique is especially useful in situations where labeled data for the target task is limited, as it helps in overcoming data scarcity issues.\n\nOverall, transfer learning is a powerful technique in the field of artificial intelligence that enables models to learn efficiently by building on existing knowledge. This approach plays a crucial role in enhancing the performance and adaptability of AI systems across a wide range of applications.",

        "final_answer": "Learning in the context of machine learning involves the process of acquiring knowledge or skills through experience, study, or instruction. One powerful technique that aids in the learning process is transfer learning. Transfer learning leverages the knowledge gained from solving one task and applies it to improve performance on another related task. This approach is particularly beneficial when the amount of data available for the new task is limited, as it allows the model to capitalize on the learnings from a different but related task.\n\nIn transfer learning, a pre-trained model is used as a starting point, and its learned features and representations are adapted to the new task. By transferring knowledge from the source task to the target task, the model can learn more efficiently and effectively. This process helps in speeding up the learning process for the new task and often results in better performance compared to training a model from scratch.\n\nOverall, transfer learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the learning capabilities of machine learning models by enabling them to build on existing knowledge and adapt it to new",

Transfer learning involves reusing knowledge or learned features from one task to improve the performance of another related task. This technique allows models to leverage pre-trained models or data from a different but related domain to enhance their performance in a new task. By transferring knowledge from one task to another, transfer learning can help improve model generalization, reduce training time, and enhance overall performance.",
